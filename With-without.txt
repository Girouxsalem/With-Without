With/Without

Too much,
Or not enough,

As empty as a void,
Or as full as a day when all you want to do is nothing,

Living with death,
Or dying with life,

Is either a viable option?,

Conclusions never reached,
Have to think about my feet 'less I fall into a trap of my own doing,

The mind is but a fly that is stuck between your eyes,
It cannot see and it does not know where it's going.
